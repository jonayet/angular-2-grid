#Angular 2 Grid

1. Use the `data.json` file to create a responsive bootstrap grid with headers **city**, **start date**, **end date**, **price**, **status**, **color**.  All the Columns should be sortable.  

2. Above the grid, please add two date pickers to filter the object by date range.

3. Please create a form with validation of the following fields **email**, **password**, **confirm password**. All fields are required, password fields have to match and at least 8 characters. If a field is not valid, highlight it and show a corresponding message.

Though this is a small app, please pay attention to your application structure.
